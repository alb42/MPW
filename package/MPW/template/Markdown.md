Markdown support test
=====================

![Markdown logo](/pics/markdownlogo.png)

This page is a small demonstration of Markdown support.  
  
From [CommonMark]:
>Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents,
>based on conventions for indicating formatting in email and Usenet posts.
>It was developed by John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swartz)
>and released in 2004 in the form of a syntax description and a
>Perl script (Markdown.pl) for converting Markdown to HTML.
>In the next decade, dozens of implementations were developed in many languages.
